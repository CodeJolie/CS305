Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report

  Artemis Financial required a secure Java Spring Boot application with robust communication channels and file verification processes. The company needed to address existing security vulnerabilities in their software.

  The identification and resolution of software security vulnerabilities were conducted thoroughly. By refactoring the code, the project adhered to security testing protocols, ensuring that the application was fortified against known threats. This process included updating dependencies, eliminating deprecated elements, and implementing vulnerability suppression where necessary.

  Secure coding is vital because it protects a company from potential breaches that can lead to data loss, financial damage, and reputational harm. For Artemis Financial, ensuring the security of their software translates to maintaining client trust and complying with industry regulations.

  One of the more challenging aspects was handling the Spring Boot and Tomcat vulnerabilities. However, the process of refactoring and suppressing these vulnerabilities provided valuable learning experiences. The use of the OWASP Dependency-Check tool was particularly helpful in identifying and addressing these issues.


  Security layers were increased by updating vulnerable dependencies, suppressing non-critical vulnerabilities, and applying industry-standard best practices. In the future, tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and continuous integration pipelines will be instrumental in ongoing vulnerability assessments and mitigation decisions.

  After refactoring, the code and application were tested to ensure they remained functional and secure. Continuous checks for new vulnerabilities were performed using the OWASP Dependency-Check tool, which confirmed the absence of new issues post-refactoring.

  Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Maven, and Eclipse were crucial in this process. They provided the framework for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities while ensuring the application remained stable.

  This assignment demonstrates my ability to identify, address, and mitigate security vulnerabilities in software. It highlights my understanding of industry best practices and my capacity to maintain both the functionality and security of critical applications. This project is a strong example of my skills in secure coding and software development.
